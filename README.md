## FX Analysis using Twitter & Market Data

### The idea of this project is to depict a use case of using Alt Data for making investment decisions.

The purpose of this project is to build a dashboard and analyze Twitter data and conversations to generate insights into the key words and terms used, which will help traders get the latest information in a streamlined, efficient and summarized format before making trading decisions. While there are sources that have individual area assistance, creating a holistic dashboard that can look at the live rates, Twitter conversations and the summary stats would be very valuable. There are multiple steps in this process such as web scraping live Twitter feeds from various accounts that cover FX Markets, performing topic modeling / NLP techniques and cleaning on the corpus of Tweets and also the market data, providing the results/trading opportunities, and also building a word cloud that can provide a quick snapshot of the assistance.
